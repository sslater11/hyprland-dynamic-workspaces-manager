# Hyprland Dynamic Workspaces Manager Script 
I prefer being able to give each workspace a name, instead of the default assigned workspace numbers.
This script allows me to create workspaces on the fly, name them and switch between them with ease.

# Features
- Create a workspace with any name that you want.
- Rename a workspace.
- Move a window to any workspace.
- Switch to any window.

# Keybindings
These are my prefered key bindings. 

I use the Windows key as my modifier.

I like using both Ctrl+Win keys together, and Alt+Win keys together. It makes launching apps and switching windows feel like the same action.

| Action                                                      | Keybinding                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |

| App launcher alternate                                      | Ctrl + Shift + Win + Space   |
| Rename Workspace                                            | Win + x                      |
| Switch to Workspace                                         | Win + z                      |
| Move the current window to another workspace                | Win + Shift + z              |
| Next workspace                                              | Win + Tab                    |
| Previous workspace                                          | Win + Shift + Tab            |
| Delete workspace and move all windows to another            | Win + Backspace              |
| Move all workspace windows to another workspace with prompt | Ctrl + Win + Backspace       |
|                                                             | OR                           |
|                                                             | Alt  + Win + Backspace       |

# Dependencies:
- rofi - The wayland fork by lbonn found at https://github.com/lbonn/rofi.git
  - rofi is used for the popup to list all workspaces/windows, and to handle all user input.
  - Other launchers aren't supported (Pull Requests welcome). You will need to edit the script to change it to another app launcher.
     - Please see this link for recommended app launchers that you may be able to get working with this script.
     - https://wiki.hyprland.org/Useful-Utilities/App-Launchers/
- python3
- hyprctl - This should be installed with Hyprland

## Why does it require rofi(the wayland fork) instead of wofi?
- Rofi has more features than wofi.
- Rofi can select a line in our list.
  - This is used when we display a list of workspaces. Our current workspace will be highlighted.
- Rofi can auto-select an item from the filtered list.
  - As we type and land on the last option, it will select it without us needing to press enter. I've disabled this by default, but it can be enabled by passing the `-auto-select` argument.

## Download this script
```
cd ~/.config/hypr/

```
See below for how to add this script to your Hyprland config.

# Usecase
I often group my windows by the project that I'm working on. I do this by placing them on a workspace with a name related to the project.

Sometimes things get disorganised and I forget which workspace I moved a window to. Having the app switcher allows me to type in the name of a window and jump straight to it.

I often run about 5+ different workspaces with several different programs. I try to keep everything open as it saves time later on when resuming a project.

Renaming workspaces is required as a things can become disorganised quickly.

I have heard that people like to keep a single workspace for their web browser, but this doesn't work for me. I often have multiple web browser windows with lots of tabs open too. I will have one for studying, one for programming, one for general use and one for media. I keep these on their respective workspaces to keep things organised.

# FAQ
## How do I use this?
Place the script into ~/.config/hypr/ and make it executable.
Create key bindings to this script in hyprland's config file.
Below is my default setup.
Add this to ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
```
# Dynamic workspace manager variable setup
$app_launcher = rofi -show drun -show-icons -theme ~/.config/hypr/hyprland-dynamic-workspaces-manager/rofi-themes-collection/themes/rounded-nord-dark.rasi

$app_launcher_all = rofi -show combi -combi-modes run,drun -show-icons -theme ~/.config/hypr/hyprland-dynamic-workspaces-manager/rofi-themes-collection/themes/rounded-nord-dark.rasi

$window_switcher          = ~/.config/hypr/hyprland-dynamic-workspaces-manager/hyprland-dynamic-workspaces-manager.py --window-switcher
$workspace_switcher       = ~/.config/hypr/hyprland-dynamic-workspaces-manager/hyprland-dynamic-workspaces-manager.py --workspace
$move_window_to_workspace = ~/.config/hypr/hyprland-dynamic-workspaces-manager/hyprland-dynamic-workspaces-manager.py --move-window

```
- Switch to a workspace, WindowsKey+Z, then type one from the list.
- Create a *NEW* workspace and switch to it, WindowsKey+Z, then type a new name. You can even use spaces in the workspace name :).
- Move a window to another workspace WindowsKey+Shift+Z, then type the workspace name.
- Move a window to a *NEW* workspace WindowsKey+Shift+Z, then type the name of the new workspace.
- Rename a workspace WindowsKey+X
- App launcher WindowsKey+Ctrl+Space 
- App launcher including terminal commands WindowsKey+Ctrl+Shift+Space 
- Window Switcher -  WindowsKey+Alt+Space 
- Next Workspace - WindowsKey+Tab
- Previous Workspace - WindowsKey+Shift+Tab

## Why are you using Win+Alt and Win+Ctrl?
I like using both Ctrl+Win keys together, and Alt+Win keys together. It makes launching apps and switching windows feel like the same action.

## Can I still use the normal workspace hotkeys 1-9?
Yes. You can still use WindowsKey+1 to access the first workspace. You can rename this workspace and you can still switch to it using the normal workspace keybinding.

## How do I delete a workspace?
You don't need to manually delete a workspace. Once a workspace is empty, and we switch to another, Hyprland will delete empty workspaces for us.
You can however delete a workspace and move all windows on the current workspace to another.

### Delete workspace with windows on it.
See the option --delete-current-workspace 

Moves all windows to a random workspace, deletes the current workspace, and then switches to the workspace we dumped the windows on to.

### Delete workspace and move windows to a workspace using a prompt
See the option --move-current-workspace-windows-to

User selects the workspace to move all the current workspace's windows to. Moves all windows to another workspace, deletes the current workspace, and then switches to the workspace we dumped the windows on to.

# Issues / Bugs
- New workspace name not set: In older versions of Hyperland(0.45.0 and below), switching to a new workspace will not name it properly, instead the workspace gets the name of its ID number which is a negative number like -1337. You'll have to rename it manually. Bug fixed in newer Hyprland versions.
- You can have multiple workspaces with the same name, but can only switch to one of those workspaces.
  - Only an issue if you are creating workspaces with hyprctl.
  - Hyprland's method that I use doesn't allow us to switch to a workspace by its ID number, so we have to use the workspace name, obviously this is an issue if we have multiple workspaces with the same name.
  - Just name each workspace differently as you should be doing anyway.
  - You can rename the workspaces.

# Themes
There quite a few themes available :).

You can view all of these by running the `theme-previewer.sh` script. Warning! The `theme-previewer.sh` script will spam you out with rofi launchers. It will ask if you want to continue. Press ESC key multiple times to quit each rofi instance and view each theme.

You can set the theme using the `--theme` argument, followed by one of these:
```
nord
rounded-blue-dark
rounded-gray-dark
rounded-green-dark
rounded-nord-dark
rounded-orange-dark
rounded-pink-dark
rounded-purple-dark
rounded-red-dark
rounded-yellow-dark
simple-tokyonight
spotlight-dark
spotlight
squared-everforest
squared-material-red
squared-nord
```

## Custom Theme
You can pass a custom rofi theme by using the `--theme-file` argument and passing it a path to the file.
